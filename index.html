                    <p>
                        The Plant Forge enables growers to do more with less: reduce labor, grow more productive plants
                        and increase overall garden efficiency with this purpose-built plant tool.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Plant Forge technology combines the advantages of traditional trellising with the benefits and
                        flexibility of mobile plant containers in garden spaces. This combination provides cultivators
                        with real advantages compared to staking plants or traditional trellising while reducing the
                        labor and difficulty of many garden workflows.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Plant Forge was invented, designed and tested by serious gardeners to withstand the rigors
                        of cultivation in the long-term. This high-quality horticultural tool is an innovative force
                        that brings gardens to the next level.

                        Gardeners have a huge advantage when they can easily rearrange their canopy spaces for
                        low-impact defoliation, thinning, plant inspections, phenotyping/sexual selection and various
                        disease/pest management applications. The added flexibility of a dynamic canopy space enables
                        the highest levels of care and attention to detail during plant life-cycles - greatly improving
                        overall plant health, yields and garden function.

                    <p>
                        Training and canopy support with the Plant Forge is 4 times faster than traditional staking due
                        to ergonomic design and functionality. The Plant Forge also trains more effectively, fills
                        canopies more efficiently, and holds tops/branches in place more reliably than stakes. Reduce
                        labor and get more effective results while keeping the advantages of a movable canopy with Plant
                        Forge technology.

                    <p>
                        Stakes have a lot of built-in drawbacks:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Bamboo stakes are an organic material that can easily become host to pathogens such as mold
                            spores, powdery mildew and even garden pests such as spider mites.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Stakes rot over time and can break easily, making them perishable garden equipment that
                            needs to be replaced.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Staked gardens result in awkward and inefficient canopy arrangements reducing yields and
                            diminishing spatial efficiency.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Staking plants is tedious and time consuming. Generally it takes 4 times longer per plant to
                            properly support with stakes than it does to support with the Plant Forge.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Stakes damage plant roots and impact growth when they are driven into the rhizome.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Plant Forge technology solves every problem associated with staking while at the same time
                        simply and effectively providing the same benefits and even improving on them. It is the clear
                        choice for growers who need plant/canopy mobility but want a better option than stakes.

                    <h1>PLANT FORGE VS TRELLIS</h1>
                    <p>
                        With traditional trellis tech, plants become grouped together in a static canopy arrangement,
                        often leaving plants in middle rows neglected, grown over, lacking optimal light and airflow.
                        This can result in subpar quality and production from a large number of plants stuck within the
                        midsections of trellis-rows.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Plant Forge fixes these issues by enabling growers to move plants easily and access the
                        interior of canopy spaces for inspections, group rotations, crucial workflows, and plant care.
                        This flexibility lets growers give optimal attention to every plant in the garden and identify
                        issues they may have otherwise not have found until it was too late. These advantages also
                        contribute to maximizing quality and yield output of every plant in a garden space.
                    </p>
                    <P>
                        For those who demand high levels of care and the utmost plant quality and productivity, the
                        Plant Forge provides a clear advantage to the traditional trellis method.

                    <p>
                        The Plant Forge is the perfect solution for the unique difficulties of phenotyping. Versatile
                        net arrangements, where cultivators can customizable net height and layer arrangement/angles,
                        can accommodate almost any strain/phenotype regardless of varying genetic expressions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another advantage of phenotyping with the Plant Forge is the ability to move plants as they grow
                        and inspect each one carefully. Genetics from seed are prone to hermaphroditism and can
                        pollinate entire garden spaces if left unchecked. Plant Forge tech enables easy, careful
                        inspection of plants so gardeners can catch issues before they become a problem.
                    </p>
                    <P>
                        These combined advantages of the Plant Forge system reduce the challenges of hunting new
                        genetics and selecting desirable phenotypes while also increasing overall product quality and
                        yields.

                    <p>
                        The efficiency of a trellis net is hard to beat! Training and supporting every vigorous branch
                        on a plant, in the efficiency of a grid, allows growers to maximize node-site exposure to light
                        sources and create the most densely populated canopy spaces possible. These benefits increase
                        overall product-quality and product-yields for each plant. Being able to capture these benefits,
                        while still being able to move plants around is an innovation not yet offered in the
                        horticulture world. The Plant Forge is the first customizable option that affords cultivators
                        the best of both worlds - the efficiency of trellis nets with plant-mobility.

                        Thinning groups of large, healthy plants is a difficult and time consuming task. When these
                        groups of plants have grown through multiple layers of fixed trellis, the task gets
                        substantially harder. Gardeners must kneel/lay/stretch/contort themselves in all sorts of ways
                        to properly thin out lower node sites once the canopy has grown through traditional trellis
                        netting. It’s a bad time and a bottle neck for gardeners.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-right">
                        Plant Forge containers resolve this bottle neck as they’re easily moved for these important

                        entire canopy spaces. It's a faster, more ergonomic solution and allows for higher quality of
                        work to be done in half the time.

                        Plant Forge containers are manufactured with high-grade recycled materials to reduce
                        carbon-output and not contribute new plastic to the world. We’re also committed to using no
                        plastic in our packaging for the same reasons. Plant Forge supports sustainable manufacturing,
                        no-plastic-packaging and a commitment to reducing carbon-output and waste in every way possible.
